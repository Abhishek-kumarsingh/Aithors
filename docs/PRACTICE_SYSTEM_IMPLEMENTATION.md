# Practice Question Bank System - Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The practice question bank system has been completely implemented and fixed to provide a comprehensive coding practice experience with AI-generated questions, 80/20 split-screen coding layout, and full database integration.

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing API Endpoints**
- **Problem**: Practice page was trying to fetch individual questions with `/api/user/practice/questions/${id}` but the endpoint didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created `app/api/user/practice/questions/[id]/route.ts` with full CRUD operations

### 2. **Empty Question Database**
- **Problem**: No practice questions were seeded in the database
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive seeding system with AI-generated questions using Gemini API

### 3. **Question Generation Workflow**
- **Problem**: No mechanism to generate and save questions to the practice bank
- **Solution**: Implemented AI-powered question generation with automatic database storage

### 4. **Schema Alignment**
- **Problem**: Frontend interfaces didn't match database schema
- **Solution**: Aligned all TypeScript interfaces with MongoDB schema structure

## ðŸš€ New Features Implemented

### 1. **Complete API Infrastructure**

#### Practice Questions API
```typescript
// Get all questions with filtering
GET /api/user/practice/questions?domain=frontend&difficulty=medium&type=coding

// Get specific question by ID

// Create new question (admin only)
POST /api/user/practice/questions

// Update question (admin only)
PUT /api/user/practice/questions/[id]

// Delete question (admin only)
DELETE /api/user/practice/questions/[id]
```

#### Admin Question Generation API
```typescript
// Generate questions using AI
